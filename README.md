<p><strong>The Verification Code Is Not Working</strong></p>

<p>&bull; Request a fresh code by clicking on I didn&rsquo;t get an email or I didn&rsquo;t get a text message options.<br /> &bull; Delete the old codes to ensure that you will enter the most recent one.<br /> &bull; Don&rsquo;t close the code entry form, otherwise you may need to go through the entire process once again.<br /> &bull; Also, you need to open your email address so that you can access the verification code with ease and reset your password.</p>
<p><strong>Can&rsquo;t Sign In Installturbotax.com After Password Reset</strong></p>

<p><strong>Not Received Text, Email, or Call With The Verification Code</strong></p>
<p>If you are not receiving your verification code even after waiting for a couple of minutes, you need to consider the following pointers:</p>
<p>&bull; Check your junk mail, as it may contain the email with the verification code.<br /> &bull; If you have provided different email accounts, check all of them for the password reset code.<br /> &bull; Make sure that Do_not_reply@intuit.com is not the blocked sender. Change it to the approved sender.<br /> &bull; If you haven&rsquo;t received the code, you can select the option labelled I didn&rsquo;t get a text, I didn&rsquo;t get an email, or I didn&rsquo;t get a phone call link.</p>
